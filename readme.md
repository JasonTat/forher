For her

- Made in React with TypeScript, simple front-end app. No backend because there is no need to keep anything on the backend for now.
- Probably will have backend for my API to call "reasons why I love you" but that's it.
- 

- Kuromi because she loves Kuromi
- Kuromi colour palette (Black, pink)
